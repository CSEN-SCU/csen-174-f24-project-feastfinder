# React + Vite + NodeJS + Socket.io
<!-- 
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

## TO DO: Nov 19th 2pm
- presist data for fetching and loading
    - getting proper group id and loading it on page
    - getting voted on resturants, counting and sending correct count
    - connected user toggle ready button (make update-status socket.io stable)
- fetching data
    - fetch real data from database for user profiles and groups
    - fetch yelp resturants for resturants (preferences are preset)


- add ons:
    - clicking on one of the resturants in final results loads google maps directions?
    - better looking UI?
