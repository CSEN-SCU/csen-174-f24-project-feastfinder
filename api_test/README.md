#### Yelp API stuff
I was able to link the preferences page and the voting page with the Yelp API, so the preferences you put give 2 real restaurants for each cuisine. I 100% guarantee I messed up some socket stuff on the server side, so I am putting my work in this folder so as not to mess anything up for now. If it seems to work I'll commit it.

The final voting page still doesn't work, but I figure that can be worked on once everything else is set up.

Also the pictures for the preferences have not been changed to the correct image so ignore that. Easy fix later.
